<p>In our class’s bracket, I managed to place fourth and 91% for ESPN. Many of the games I missed were upsets that the bracket didn’t predict.</p>
<p>My two upsets in the East region were the BYU v. UCLA game and the Texas v. Aibileen Christian game. BYU had a 56% chance of winning, yet UCLA won, 73-62. In the second round, I had a prediction of BYU having only a 49% chance of winning against Texas. But because it was close, and the model had only a 72% success rate, I put down that BYU would win. I decided this because BYU’s women’s cross country and track team had done really well the week before for NCAA’s, and I figured that would apply to the men’s basketball team too.
My Midwest region saw the biggest collection of losses overall that impacted my bracket, but had only one loss in the first round. My model predicted Tennessee would win their first round game, with predicted chance of winning being 94 percent. However, they lost to Oregon State 70-56. In the South region, the biggest upset in my model was the Ohio State v. Oral Roberts. Ohio State had a 96% chance of winning. However, they ended up losing 75-72.</p>
<p>In the West region of my bracket the only loss I had that occurred in the first round was the Virginia v. Ohio game. My model predicted that Virginia had a 89 percent chance of winning, but they ended up losing to Ohio, 62-58.</p>
<p>Many of the losses in my games were just upsets that occurred between the two teams, and teams performed better than predicted.</p>
<p>Overall, I don’t think I could have done better on my own. I don’t usually follow men’s basketball, so I think using the model helped a lot.</p>
