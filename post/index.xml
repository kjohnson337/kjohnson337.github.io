      <description>In our class’s bracket, I managed to place fourth and 91% for ESPN. Many of the games I missed were upsets that the bracket didn’t predict.
My two upsets in the East region were the BYU v. UCLA game and the Texas v. Aibileen Christian game. BYU had a 56% chance of winning, yet UCLA won, 73-62. In the second round, I had a prediction of BYU having only a 49% chance of winning against Texas.</description>

      <description>In order to fill out my bracket for the NCAA Mens Basketball Tournament I used machine learning as part of my Advanced Sports Data Analysis. While I’m involved in athletics (soccer and cross country/track in high school and now both cross country and track at the collegiate level) I know very little about basketball and don’t follow the sport much, besides seeing scores of the Nebraska women’s team on Twitter.</description>
